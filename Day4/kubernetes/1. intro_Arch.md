# Kubernetes Overview

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes, also known as "K8s", is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google. It is designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. Kubernetes provides a consistent and reliable way to manage applications, whether they are running on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.

## Why Kubernetes?
Kubernetes exists to manage containerized applications at scale, providing automation, scalability, and resilience. It addresses several challenges that arise when running containers in production:

1. **Automated Deployment & Scaling**  
   - Kubernetes automates rolling updates and rollbacks.
   - It can scale applications up or down based on demand (e.g., CPU/memory usage).

2. **Load Balancing & Traffic Management**  
   - Kubernetes distributes network traffic to ensure stable application performance.

3. **Self-Healing & Fault Tolerance**  
   - If a container crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it.
   - If a node fails, Kubernetes shifts workloads to healthy nodes.

4. **Resource Optimization**  
   - Kubernetes efficiently schedules workloads to maximize resource utilization.
   - It optimizes CPU and memory usage across multiple applications.

5. **Service Discovery & Networking**  
   - Kubernetes provides built-in DNS-based service discovery.
   - Services can communicate with each other using stable network addresses.

6. **Portability & Flexibility**  
   - Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic and works on **AWS, Azure, GCP, on-premises, and hybrid environments**.
   - It supports multiple container runtimes (Docker, containerd, CRI-O).

7. **Security & Configuration Management**  
   - Kubernetes manages sensitive data using **Secrets**.
   - It isolates workloads for better security.

## What is Microservices?
Microservices is an architectural pattern where an application is structured as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Each service performs a specific function and communicates with other services over well-defined APIs.

## Master Node Components

### 1. **API Server**
The API server is the front end of the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API and handles requests from users and other components.

### 2. **Scheduler**
The scheduler assigns pods to nodes based on resource availability and other factors.

### 3. **Controller Manager**
The controller manager ensures the desired state of resources is maintained. Some important controllers are:
- **Node Controller**: Monitors node health.
- **Replication Controller**: Ensures the desired number of pods are running.
- **Endpoint Controller**: Manages services and their endpoints.
- **Job Controller**: Manages one-off tasks.
- **DaemonSet Controller**: Ensures a pod runs on all or specified nodes.

### 4. **etcd Database**
A consistent and highly-available key-value store used as the backing store for all cluster data.

## Worker Node Components

### 1. **Kubelet**
An agent running on each node, ensuring containers are running as specified in a Pod.

### 2. **Kube-proxy**
A network proxy that maintains network rules for pods and handles communication between services and pods.

Here is the information about Kubernetes deployment methods formatted as a `README.md` file.

# ☸️ Kubernetes Cluster Deployment Methods

Kubernetes clusters can be deployed in several major environments, which generally fall into three categories based on management overhead and infrastructure location.

## 🏗️ Deployment Categories

Identified the primary ways Kubernetes clusters are deployed:

### 1. Local / Development Environments 💻
These are designed for single-node testing, local development, and learning. They prioritize **speed and simplicity** over production-readiness and high availability.

* **Minikube:** Runs a single-node K8s cluster inside a VM on your laptop.
* **MicroK8s:** A lightweight, CNCF-certified distribution that can run easily on local machines or edge devices, often directly as containers or snaps.
* **`kind` (Kubernetes in Docker):** Runs the control plane and worker nodes as Docker containers themselves. Excellent for CI/CD integration and fast bootstrapping.
* **K3d:** A wrapper for running K3s (a lightweight Kubernetes distribution) clusters inside Docker.

### 2. On-Premise / Self-Managed Servers 🏢
This involves setting up a cluster on infrastructure you own and manage (physical servers or your own Virtual Machines).

* **`kubeadm`:** This is the standard bootstrapping tool provided by the Kubernetes project. It sets up the necessary components (API Server, etcd, Controller Manager, Kubelet) for a production-grade, multi-node cluster but requires you to manage **everything else** (networking, storage, upgrades).

### 3. Managed Cloud Services (Managed Kubernetes) ☁️
These offerings abstract away the complexity of managing the **Control Plane** (API server, etcd, etc.), allowing users to focus almost entirely on deploying workloads (Pods, Deployments).

* **EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service):** AWS's managed Kubernetes offering.
* **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service):** Microsoft Azure's managed Kubernetes offering.
* **GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine):** Google Cloud's managed Kubernetes offering (Kubernetes originated at Google).

## Key Differences in Approach

The choice of environment dictates what you need to manage:

| Environment Type | Control Plane Management | Primary Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local** | Handled by the tool (Minikube/kind) | Local testing and development speed. |
| **On-Premise** (`kubeadm`) | **Manually managed** by the user/team. | Full control over infrastructure, networking, and security. |
| **Cloud Managed** (EKS/AKS/GKE) | **Managed** by the cloud provider. | Workload deployment, scalability, and cloud integration. |

# Common Questions

### 1. Is Docker mandatory for Kubernetes?
Kubernetes requires container technologies to orchestrate, but Docker is not mandatory. It supports other container runtimes as well.

### 2. How is Kubernetes different from Docker?
Docker is primarily a container runtime, while Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers across multiple hosts, whereas Docker is used to build and run individual containers.

### 3. Is Kubernetes open-source or commercial?
Kubernetes is completely open-source and free to use.

### 4. What problems does Kubernetes solve?
Kubernetes manages multiple Docker hosts/nodes under a cluster, scales and automates container management, and ensures high availability of applications.

### 5. What benefits does Kubernetes bring?
Kubernetes provides a modular-based structure for managing containerized applications, which includes auto-scaling, rolling updates, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities.

### 6. Are there any Kubernetes alternatives?
Yes, alternatives include OpenShift, Docker Swarm, and others.

### 7. What about Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), AWS Kubernetes Service (EKS), and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)?
These are cloud-managed services for Kubernetes, providing managed environments for running Kubernetes clusters.
